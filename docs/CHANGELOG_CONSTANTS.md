# Audio Duration Constants Implementation

## Summary

Added named constants for audio duration validation limits to eliminate magic numbers and improve
code maintainability.

## Changes Made

### Constants Added to `speakr-types/src/lib.rs`

```rust
/// Minimum allowed audio recording duration in seconds.
///
/// Set to 1 second to ensure meaningful audio capture while preventing
/// accidental zero-duration recordings.
pub const MIN_AUDIO_DURATION_SECS: u32 = 1;

/// Maximum allowed audio recording duration in seconds.
///
/// Set to 30 seconds to balance memory usage and practical dictation needs.
/// Longer recordings may consume excessive memory and processing time.
pub const MAX_AUDIO_DURATION_SECS: u32 = 30;
```

### Integration Points

The constants are now used in:

1. **Validation Logic**: `AppSettings::validate_audio_duration()` uses the constants instead of
   hardcoded values
2. **Error Messages**: Validation error messages reference the constants for consistency
3. **Unit Tests**: All test cases use the constants to ensure consistency

### Documentation Updates

Updated the following files to reflect the constants usage:

- `README.md`: Added "Constants over magic numbers" to code quality standards
- `docs/SYSTEM_DESCRIPTION.md`: Updated audio configuration section to reference constants
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_OVERVIEW.md`: Updated completed components section
- `.kiro/specs/fr-2-audio-capture/fr-2-review.md`: Marked magic numbers issue as resolved
- `.kiro/specs/fr-2-audio-capture/tasks.md`: Added constants implementation note

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for validation limits
2. **Consistency**: All validation logic uses the same values
3. **Documentation**: Constants include comprehensive documentation explaining the rationale
4. **Testing**: Test cases automatically stay in sync with validation limits

## Code Quality Impact

This change addresses the code review feedback about magic numbers and aligns with the project's
code quality standards requiring named constants for validation limits and defaults.
