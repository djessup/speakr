# Speakr Documentation

**Speakr** is a privacy-first, hot-key–driven dictation utility that turns your speech into typed
text entirely on-device.

This site is organised to help different audiences quickly find the information they need:

| Audience                      | Section                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Product owners & stakeholders | [Product Requirements](PRD.md)                       |
| Engineers & contributors      | [Architecture & System Description](ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Prompt tinkerers              | [Prompt Crafting](PROMPT.md)                         |
