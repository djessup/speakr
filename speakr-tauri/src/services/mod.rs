// ============================================================================
//! Service Layer â€“ Module Root
// ============================================================================
//!
//! This module contains service implementations for:
//! - **Global hotkey management** - Handles system-wide keyboard shortcuts
//! - **Backend status tracking** - Monitors service component health and readiness
//! - **Service component types** - Shared enums and types across services
//!
//! # Service Architecture
//!
//! Services in Speakr follow a singleton pattern with global state management:
//! 1. Each service has a `*Service` struct for managing state
//! 2. Services are accessed through `*_internal()` functions
//! 3. Global state is protected by mutex guards for thread safety
//! 4. Services emit status updates through the Tauri event system
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! All services are designed to be thread-safe and can be accessed from
//! multiple contexts (frontend events, background tasks, tests) without
//! data races or corruption.
