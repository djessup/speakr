# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Status Events feature provides a real-time event system for broadcasting application status
updates across all components. Using async channels and the Tauri event system, the feature enables
decoupled communication between backend services and frontend components, allowing UI overlays,
logging systems, and other consumers to react to status changes without tight coupling to business
logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time status updates in the UI, so that I know what the
application is doing during dictation workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any service changes status THEN a status event SHALL be emitted within 10 milliseconds
2. WHEN a status event is emitted THEN the UI overlay SHALL reflect the change within 50
   milliseconds
3. WHEN multiple status changes occur THEN they SHALL be delivered in the correct order
4. WHEN the application is idle THEN periodic heartbeat events SHALL be emitted

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a decoupled event system, so that I can add new status
consumers without modifying existing business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services need to emit status THEN they SHALL use a public `emit_status()` API
2. WHEN components need status updates THEN they SHALL use a public `subscribe_status()` API
3. WHEN new consumers are added THEN existing services SHALL not require modification
4. WHEN events are emitted THEN they SHALL be delivered to all active subscribers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive status event types, so that I can provide
detailed feedback about different application states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio recording starts THEN a `Recording` event SHALL be emitted
2. WHEN transcription begins THEN a `Transcribing` event SHALL be emitted
3. WHEN text injection completes THEN an `Injected` event SHALL be emitted
4. WHEN errors occur THEN an `Error` event SHALL be emitted with details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable event delivery, so that status updates are never
missed or duplicated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are emitted THEN they SHALL include accurate timestamps
2. WHEN events are delivered THEN no events SHALL be missed during normal operation
3. WHEN events are delivered THEN no duplicate events SHALL be received
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN event delivery SHALL remain reliable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging of status events, so that I can debug
issues and monitor application behaviour.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN status events are emitted THEN they SHALL be logged with timestamps
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with full context and stack traces
3. WHEN events are logged THEN they SHALL include relevant payload data
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN event history SHALL be accessible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want the event system to be robust under stress, so
that it remains reliable during intensive usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running a 1-hour monkey test THEN no events SHALL be missed
2. WHEN performing 500 rapid invocations THEN no duplicate events SHALL occur
3. WHEN the system is under high load THEN event latency SHALL remain under 50ms
4. WHEN stress testing THEN the event system SHALL not cause memory leaks or crashes
