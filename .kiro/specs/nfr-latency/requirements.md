# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the latency performance requirements for Speakr to ensure responsive user
experience. The system must provide sub-3-second end-to-end latency from hotkey activation to text
injection, maintaining competitive advantage over cloud-based dictation services while preserving
conversational flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want dictation to complete quickly so that I can maintain my workflow
without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user activates dictation with a 5-second audio clip THEN the system SHALL complete text
   injection within 3 seconds (95th percentile) on Apple Silicon M1 hardware
2. WHEN using the small Whisper model in release builds THEN latency measurements SHALL be collected
   for every invocation
3. WHEN background services are running THEN the latency target SHALL still be maintained under
   normal system load

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated latency monitoring so that performance regressions
are caught before release.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN telemetry SHALL automatically log latency for every dictation
   invocation
2. WHEN CI tests execute THEN automated performance tests SHALL validate P95 latency â‰¤ 3s on GitHub
   Actions M1 runners
3. WHEN P95 latency exceeds 3 seconds THEN the build SHALL fail to prevent performance regressions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive latency testing so that
performance is validated across different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL measure latency across different audio clip lengths
   (1s, 3s, 5s, 10s)
2. WHEN testing different models THEN latency SHALL be measured for small, medium, and large Whisper
   models
3. WHEN system load varies THEN latency tests SHALL validate performance under different CPU and
   memory conditions
