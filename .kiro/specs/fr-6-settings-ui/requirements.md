# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Settings UI feature provides a graphical interface for user configuration through a Tauri window
accessible from the system tray or menu bar. Built with Leptos and compiled to WebAssembly, the
interface allows users to configure global hotkeys, select Whisper models, manage auto-launch
preferences, and other application settings. The implementation emphasizes real-time validation,
immediate effect application, and responsive user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access settings quickly from the system tray, so that I can
configure the application without searching through menus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the system tray icon THEN a settings window SHALL appear within 200 milliseconds
2. WHEN the settings window is already open THEN clicking the tray SHALL bring it to focus
3. WHEN I close the settings window THEN the application SHALL continue running in the background
4. WHEN the settings window opens THEN it SHALL display current configuration values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure my global hotkey with real-time validation, so that I
can set up a key combination that works and doesn't conflict with other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access hotkey settings THEN I SHALL see the current hotkey configuration
2. WHEN I enter a new hotkey THEN the system SHALL validate it in real-time
3. WHEN I enter an invalid hotkey THEN inline error messages SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN I save a valid hotkey THEN it SHALL take effect immediately without restart

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select different Whisper model sizes, so that I can balance
transcription accuracy and performance based on my needs and system capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access model settings THEN I SHALL see available model size options (small, medium, large)
2. WHEN a model is not available THEN the option SHALL be disabled with explanation
3. WHEN I select a different model THEN availability SHALL be checked before allowing selection
4. WHEN I change the model THEN the transcription engine SHALL update without requiring restart

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure auto-launch settings, so that I can control whether
Speakr starts automatically when I log into my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access auto-launch settings THEN I SHALL see the current auto-launch status
2. WHEN I toggle auto-launch THEN the system SHALL update the login item immediately
3. WHEN auto-launch is enabled THEN Speakr SHALL start automatically on system login
4. WHEN auto-launch changes fail THEN clear error messages SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all settings changes to be applied immediately, so that I can test
configurations without restarting the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change any setting THEN it SHALL take effect immediately
2. WHEN settings are changed THEN they SHALL be persisted automatically
3. WHEN settings fail to save THEN error messages SHALL be displayed with retry options
4. WHEN the application restarts THEN all settings SHALL be restored to their last saved state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear validation and error messages, so that I understand what
went wrong and how to fix configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation fails THEN specific error messages SHALL be displayed inline
2. WHEN model files are missing THEN actionable error messages SHALL suggest solutions
3. WHEN hotkey conflicts occur THEN alternative suggestions SHALL be provided
4. WHEN system permissions are required THEN clear guidance SHALL be provided

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the settings UI to integrate seamlessly with the backend
services, so that configuration changes are properly synchronized across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI loads THEN current settings SHALL be retrieved from the backend
2. WHEN settings change THEN they SHALL be validated by the backend before saving
3. WHEN backend services update THEN the UI SHALL reflect the current state
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly propagated from backend to UI
