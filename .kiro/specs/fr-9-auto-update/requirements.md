# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Auto-update feature provides optional automatic application updates via GitHub Releases,
ensuring users can easily stay current with the latest features and security fixes. The system
performs secure downloads with signature verification while giving users full control over the
update process. The feature is designed to be completely optional and degrade gracefully when
disabled.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to automatically check for updates, so that I can
stay current with the latest features and security fixes without manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-update is enabled THEN the system SHALL check GitHub Releases daily for newer versions
2. WHEN checking for updates THEN the operation SHALL run outside the main thread to prevent UI
   freezing
3. WHEN a newer version is available THEN the system SHALL notify the user with release notes
4. WHEN no update is available THEN the check SHALL complete silently without user notification
5. WHEN network issues prevent checking for updates THEN the check SHALL fail gracefully and
   silently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want updates to be downloaded and verified securely,
so that I can trust the integrity of the updated application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN downloading updates THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS for secure transmission
2. WHEN an update is downloaded THEN the system SHALL verify the code signature before installation
3. WHEN signature verification fails THEN the update SHALL be rejected and the user notified
4. WHEN updates are downloaded THEN they SHALL pass macOS notarization verification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want control over when updates are applied, so that I can review
changes and choose the right time for updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an update is available THEN the system SHALL display release notes to the user
2. WHEN update notification appears THEN the user SHALL be required to confirm before applying
3. WHEN the user declines an update THEN the system SHALL not apply it automatically
4. WHEN the user confirms an update THEN the system SHALL proceed with installation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the ability to disable auto-updates completely, so that I can
control my application update process manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access settings THEN I SHALL see an option to enable/disable auto-updates
2. WHEN auto-updates are disabled THEN no network calls SHALL be made for update checking
3. WHEN auto-updates are disabled THEN the system SHALL not prompt for updates
4. WHEN I disable auto-updates THEN the setting SHALL persist across application restarts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the update system to be reliable and not interfere with normal
application operation, so that update failures don't impact my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN update checks fail THEN the failure SHALL be logged but not crash the application
2. WHEN network connectivity is unavailable THEN update checks SHALL fail gracefully
3. WHEN update installation fails THEN the current application SHALL remain functional
4. WHEN update processes run THEN they SHALL not interfere with dictation functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the update system to integrate cleanly with the existing
application architecture, so that it works seamlessly with settings and UI systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN update settings change THEN they SHALL be persisted using the existing settings system
2. WHEN update notifications appear THEN they SHALL use the existing UI notification system
3. WHEN update status changes THEN it SHALL be reported through the existing status system
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL use the existing error handling and logging systems
