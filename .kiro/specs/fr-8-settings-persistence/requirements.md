# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Settings Persistence feature provides local storage of user preferences using JSON files in
platform-appropriate directories. The system ensures data privacy by keeping all settings on-device,
implements atomic writes to prevent corruption, and includes a migration framework for future schema
evolution. The implementation emphasizes reliability, performance, and data integrity while
maintaining complete offline capability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my settings to be saved locally on my device, so that my
preferences are preserved between application sessions without requiring internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN settings SHALL be loaded from the local file system
2. WHEN no settings file exists THEN default settings SHALL be created automatically
3. WHEN settings are loaded THEN they SHALL be available within 50 milliseconds
4. WHEN the application runs THEN no settings data SHALL leave the device

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my settings changes to be saved immediately, so that I don't lose
my preferences if the application crashes or is force-quit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change a setting THEN it SHALL be saved to disk within 100 milliseconds
2. WHEN settings are saved THEN the write operation SHALL be atomic to prevent corruption
3. WHEN multiple settings change rapidly THEN all changes SHALL be persisted correctly
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN settings saves SHALL still complete reliably

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to recover gracefully from corrupted settings, so
that I can continue using the application even if the settings file becomes damaged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the settings file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL detect the corruption
2. WHEN corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to restore from backup
3. WHEN backup restoration fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to default settings
4. WHEN recovery occurs THEN the user SHALL be notified of the recovery action

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a migration framework for settings schema evolution, so that
future versions can update settings structure without breaking existing installations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN settings are loaded THEN the schema version SHALL be checked
2. WHEN an older schema is detected THEN migration SHALL be performed automatically
3. WHEN migration occurs THEN the original settings SHALL be backed up first
4. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to default settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my settings stored in the standard application data directory, so
that they follow platform conventions and can be easily backed up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN on macOS THEN settings SHALL be stored in `~/Library/Application Support/Speakr/`
2. WHEN the settings directory doesn't exist THEN it SHALL be created automatically
3. WHEN directory permissions are insufficient THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided
4. WHEN settings are stored THEN they SHALL use the JSON format for human readability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for settings operations, so that
all failure scenarios are handled gracefully with appropriate user feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file I/O operations fail THEN specific error messages SHALL be provided
2. WHEN JSON parsing fails THEN the error SHALL include context about the corruption
3. WHEN directory permissions are denied THEN guidance SHALL be provided for resolution
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
