# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the footprint requirements for Speakr to ensure lightweight operation and
minimal resource consumption. The system must maintain strict limits on binary size and memory usage
to reduce download size, disk usage, and memory pressure on older devices whilst preserving
performance and functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a lightweight application so that it downloads quickly and doesn't
consume excessive disk space or system resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built for release THEN the universal macOS binary SHALL be ≤ 20MB
   (excluding Whisper model files)
2. WHEN the application runs standard transcription workloads THEN peak RSS memory usage SHALL be ≤
   400MB including loaded models
3. WHEN memory usage is measured during 30-second monkey tests THEN it SHALL remain within the 400MB
   limit consistently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated footprint monitoring so that size and memory
regressions are caught before release.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI builds execute THEN binary size SHALL be automatically measured and validated against the
   20MB limit
2. WHEN the application runs THEN memory usage SHALL be continuously monitored and logged during
   operation
3. WHEN footprint limits are exceeded THEN the build SHALL fail to prevent resource consumption
   regressions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive footprint testing so that
resource usage is validated across different scenarios and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN footprint tests run THEN they SHALL measure binary size across different build
   configurations (debug vs release, feature flags)
2. WHEN memory testing executes THEN it SHALL validate usage across different Whisper models (small,
   medium, large)
3. WHEN system load varies THEN memory usage SHALL be measured under different operational
   conditions and workloads

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed resource usage reporting so that I can
understand the application's impact on system resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application operates THEN detailed memory allocation patterns SHALL be tracked and
   reported
2. WHEN footprint analysis runs THEN binary size breakdown SHALL identify the largest components and
   dependencies
3. WHEN resource monitoring is active THEN historical usage trends SHALL be collected for capacity
   planning
