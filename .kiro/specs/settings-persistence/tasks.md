# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up core settings persistence infrastructure
  - Create settings module structure with commands, persistence, validation, and migration submodules
  - Implement basic AppSettings type with version, hot_key, model_size, and auto_launch fields
  - Set up directory structure for settings operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 2. Implement atomic file operations for settings storage
  - Create save_settings_to_dir function with atomic write operations using temporary files
  - Implement backup creation before overwriting existing settings
  - Add proper error handling for file I/O operations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 6.1_

- [x] 3. Implement settings loading with corruption recovery
  - Create load_settings_from_dir function with backup recovery mechanism
  - Implement try_load_settings_file helper for individual file loading
  - Add fallback to default settings when both main and backup files are corrupted
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Create settings migration framework
  - Implement migrate_settings function with version detection
  - Add support for migrating from version 0 to version 1
  - Include proper logging and error handling for migration failures
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Implement directory validation and permissions checking
  - Create validate_settings_directory_permissions function
  - Add write permission testing using temporary file creation
  - Provide clear error messages for permission issues
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 6.1, 6.3_

- [x] 6. Create Tauri command interface for settings operations
  - Implement save_settings and load_settings Tauri commands
  - Create internal save_settings_internal and load_settings_internal functions
  - Add proper error handling and logging for command operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 6.1, 6.4_

- [x] 7. Implement comprehensive unit tests for core functionality
  - Create tests for settings serialization and deserialization
  - Add tests for atomic write operations and corruption recovery
  - Implement tests for migration functionality and directory validation
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3, 3.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 8. Add timestamp tracking for settings operations
  - Add created_at and updated_at fields to AppSettings structure
  - Update save operations to set updated_at timestamp automatically
  - Ensure timestamps are preserved during migration operations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 9. Implement performance optimization with debounced saves
  - Create settings cache mechanism to avoid repeated disk reads
  - Implement debounced save operations to batch rapid setting changes
  - Add performance tests to ensure sub-100ms save operations
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1, 2.4_

- [ ] 10. Enhance error handling with specific error types
  - Create SettingsError enum with specific error variants for different failure scenarios
  - Update all settings operations to use specific error types instead of generic strings
  - Add context information to errors for better debugging and user feedback
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 11. Add comprehensive integration tests
  - Create end-to-end tests for complete save/load workflow
  - Add tests for concurrent settings operations and race conditions
  - Implement stress tests for rapid setting changes and system load scenarios
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4, 6.4_

- [ ] 12. Implement settings backup management
  - Add functionality to maintain multiple backup versions
  - Create cleanup mechanism for old backup files
  - Add recovery options for users when corruption is detected
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
