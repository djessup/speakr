# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the reliability requirements for Speakr to ensure stable operation under
heavy usage and graceful error recovery. The system must demonstrate crash-free operation during
extended use and provide robust error handling for common failure scenarios, building user trust and
reducing support overhead.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remain stable during extended use so that I can
rely on it for daily dictation tasks without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs a 1-hour monkey test with 500 sequential invocations THEN the system
   SHALL complete without any crashes or unrecoverable errors
2. WHEN heavy usage patterns are simulated THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable without leaks or
   unbounded growth
3. WHEN the application encounters errors THEN it SHALL recover gracefully and continue normal
   operation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when errors occur so that I understand what
happened and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio devices become unavailable THEN the system SHALL detect the condition and provide
   clear error messaging through Status Events
2. WHEN Whisper models are missing or corrupted THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error
   and guide users toward resolution
3. WHEN text injection fails THEN the system SHALL retry with fallback mechanisms and report the
   outcome to users

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive reliability testing so that stability issues
are caught before release.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI tests execute THEN automated soak tests SHALL simulate 500 sequential invocations without
   crashes
2. WHEN error conditions are simulated THEN recovery mechanisms SHALL be validated through automated
   testing
3. WHEN reliability tests fail THEN the build SHALL be blocked to prevent unstable releases

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a support engineer, I want detailed error logging so that I can diagnose and
resolve user issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN comprehensive diagnostic information SHALL be logged with appropriate
   severity levels
2. WHEN crashes happen THEN crash reports SHALL be generated with stack traces and system context
3. WHEN users report issues THEN logs SHALL provide sufficient information for root cause analysis
