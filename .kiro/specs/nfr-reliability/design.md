# Design Document

## Overview

The reliability validation system ensures Speakr maintains stability across heavy usage through
comprehensive soak testing, error simulation, and recovery validation. This design focuses on
creating automated testing infrastructure that validates crash-free operation and graceful error
handling across all system components.

### Components Overview

1. **Soak Testing Framework**: Extended operation validation with 500+ invocations
2. **Error Simulation System**: Controlled failure injection and recovery testing
3. **Crash Detection & Reporting**: Automated crash detection with diagnostic collection
4. **Recovery Validation**: Automated testing of error handling and graceful degradation

## Components and Interfaces

### Soak Testing Framework

**Location**: `speakr-tauri/tests/reliability/`

**Responsibilities**:

- Execute extended operation tests (1-hour, 500+ invocations)
- Monitor system stability during sustained load
- Detect memory leaks and resource exhaustion
- Validate consistent performance over time

**Key Interfaces**:

```rust
pub struct SoakTestRunner {
    duration: Duration,
    invocation_count: usize,
    monitoring: SystemMonitor,
}

impl SoakTestRunner {
    pub fn new(duration: Duration, invocations: usize) -> Self;
    pub async fn run_test(&self) -> SoakTestResult;
    pub fn with_monitoring(self, monitor: SystemMonitor) -> Self;
}

pub struct SoakTestResult {
    pub completed_invocations: usize,
    pub crashes: Vec<CrashReport>,
    pub memory_profile: MemoryProfile,
    pub performance_degradation: Option<PerformanceDegradation>,
    pub passed: bool,
}
```

### Error Simulation System

**Location**: `speakr-core/src/testing/error_simulation/`

**Responsibilities**:

- Inject controlled failures into system components
- Simulate common error conditions (device unavailable, model missing)
- Validate error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Test graceful degradation scenarios

**Error Scenarios**:

1. **Audio Device Failures**: Device disconnection, permission denial, format changes
2. **Model Loading Errors**: Missing files, corrupted models, insufficient memory
3. **Text Injection Failures**: Permission issues, target application changes
4. **System Resource Exhaustion**: Memory pressure, disk space, CPU overload

### Crash Detection & Reporting

**Location**: `speakr-tauri/src/monitoring/crash_detection/`

**Responsibilities**:

- Detect application crashes and unhandled panics
- Collect diagnostic information and system context
- Generate structured crash reports for analysis
- Integrate with CI for automated crash detection

**Crash Report Structure**:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct CrashReport {
    pub timestamp: SystemTime,
    pub crash_type: CrashType,
    pub stack_trace: String,
    pub system_info: SystemInfo,
    pub application_state: ApplicationState,
    pub recent_operations: Vec<Operation>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum CrashType {
    Panic(String),
    Segmentation,
    OutOfMemory,
    UnhandledException(String),
}
```

### Recovery Validation System

**Location**: `speakr-tauri/src/testing/recovery/`

**Responsibilities**:

- Test error recovery mechanisms across all components
- Validate graceful degradation under failure conditions
- Ensure system remains operational after errors
- Test user notification and guidance systems

## Data Models

### Reliability Metrics Structure

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct ReliabilityMetrics {
    pub test_session_id: Uuid,
    pub timestamp: SystemTime,
    pub uptime_seconds: u64,
    pub total_invocations: usize,
    pub successful_invocations: usize,
    pub error_count: usize,
    pub crash_count: usize,
    pub memory_usage: MemoryUsage,
    pub error_breakdown: HashMap<String, usize>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct MemoryUsage {
    pub initial_mb: u64,
    pub peak_mb: u64,
    pub final_mb: u64,
    pub leak_detected: bool,
}
```

### System Monitor Structure

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct SystemMonitor {
    start_time: Instant,
    memory_samples: Vec<MemorySample>,
    cpu_samples: Vec<CpuSample>,
    error_log: Vec<ErrorEvent>,
}

impl SystemMonitor {
    pub fn start() -> Self;
    pub fn sample_resources(&mut self);
    pub fn record_error(&mut self, error: ErrorEvent);
    pub fn generate_report(self) -> SystemReport;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Test Environment Failures

- **CI runner instability**: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- **Resource contention**: Isolated test execution with resource monitoring
- **Timing-dependent failures**: Statistical validation across multiple runs

### Error Simulation Failures

- **Injection mechanism failures**: Fallback to manual error triggering
- **Recovery timeout**: Configurable timeout with graceful test termination
- **State corruption**: Test isolation with clean state restoration

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Error simulation mechanism accuracy
- Crash detection and reporting functionality
- Recovery mechanism validation
- Memory leak detection algorithms

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end soak testing pipeline
- Error injection and recovery workflows
- Crash reporting integration
- CI reliability test execution

### Soak Tests

- **Standard Soak Test**: 500 invocations over 1 hour
- **Extended Soak Test**: 1000+ invocations over 4 hours
- **Memory Stress Test**: Sustained operation under memory pressure
- **Error Recovery Test**: Repeated error injection and recovery cycles

### Acceptance Tests

- Zero crashes during 500-invocation test
- Graceful error recovery validation
- Comprehensive error logging verification
- CI integration and build gating
