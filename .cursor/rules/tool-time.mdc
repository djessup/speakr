**ALWAYS use the available Time tools when referencing the current date or time in documentation, code, or any other text.**

If you don't use the tools, you will make mistakes and frustrate the user.

## 1. Get Current Time: `get_current_time`
**Use when you need the current date or time.**

## 2. Convert Time: `convert_time`
**Use when converting between timezones.**

## 3. Fallback tool: Terminal/CLI
**Use command line tools as a fallback if the Time tools are not available or not working.**
- On macOS or Linux, use `date` to get the current date and time.
- On Windows, use `cmd /c "date /t && time /t"` to get the current date and time.
