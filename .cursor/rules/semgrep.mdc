# Semgrep MCP Tool Guidance

This rule explains **when** and **how** to invoke the Semgrep MCP static analysis tool from within Cursor.

## When to apply

Use Semgrep whenever you need to:

1. Perform a **security audit** or **static analysis** over the codebase.
2. Detect **code smells**, **bug-prone patterns**, or **insecure practices**.
3. Validate contributions against organisation-specific Semgrep rulesets.
4. Respond to user requests that explicitly mention "semgrep", "static scan", or "security scan".

## How to invoke

1. Run the Semgrep MCP tool with the appropriate parameters, for example:
   ```bash
   semgrep --config=auto --json
   ```
   or, if a custom configuration exists:
   ```bash
   semgrep --config ./semgrep/ --json
   ```
2. Scope the scan to relevant paths when the user specifies (e.g. `src/` or a particular file).
3. Parse the JSON output and present a concise summary of findings, grouped by severity.

## Interpreting results

Each Semgrep finding includes:
- **rule id** – identifies the pattern that triggered
- **path & line** – location in source
- **severity & message** – explanation of the issue

Convert these into actionable feedback, suggesting precise fixes or refactors. Quote the affected code region using Cursor's code-citation format like:
```12:18:src/file.rs
// ... existing code ...
```

## Follow-up actions

After reporting findings, you may:
1. Offer to apply automatic fixes (`--fix` flag) if available.
2. Implement manual code edits where automatic fixing is insufficient.
3. Add remediation tasks to the project backlog if larger refactors are required.
