When creating new `.mdc` rules in `.cursor/rules/`:

1. **File Naming Convention**:
    - Follow the pattern: `<scope>-<rule-name>.mdc`.
    - `<scope>` is a prefix like `python`, `agent`, `git`, etc.
    - Use existing scopes as a convention. Create new ones logically if no existing scope fits.

2. **Token Economy**:
    - Write concise rules. Every token counts.
    - Use examples if they clarify a complex rule more efficiently than text alone.
    - Read the [rule-compression](agent-rule-compression.mdc) rule for tips on how to write concise rules.

3. **File Location**:
    - All new rules must be placed in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.
