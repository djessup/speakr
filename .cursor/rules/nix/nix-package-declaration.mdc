description: Enforce lowercase-hyphenated pnames, semantic versions as strings, explicit build/native inputs, and comprehensive meta attributes in every package declaration.

## Description
This rule enforces best practices for package declarations and naming conventions in Nix files.

## Rule Details
- Package names should be lowercase and use hyphens for word separation
- Version numbers should be declared as strings
- Dependencies should be explicitly declared in the buildInputs or nativeBuildInputs
- Package attributes should be properly documented with comments
- Use semantic versioning for package versions

## Examples

### Good
```nix
{ lib
, stdenv
, fetchFromGitHub
, rustPlatform
}:

rustPlatform.buildRustPackage rec {
  pname = "my-package";
  version = "0.1.0";

  src = fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "owner";
    repo = "repo";
    rev = "v${version}";
  };

  cargoSha256 = "sha256-...";

  meta = with lib; {
    description = "A well-documented package";
    homepage = "https://github.com/owner/repo";
    license = licenses.mit;
    maintainers = with maintainers; [ /* list of maintainers */ ];
  };
}
```

### Bad
```nix
{ stdenv }:

stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "MyPackage-1.0";  # Incorrect naming convention
  src = ./.;  # Missing version declaration
  # Missing dependency declarations
  # Missing meta information
}
```

## Why
- Consistent naming makes packages easier to find and maintain
- Explicit dependency declarations prevent build failures
- Proper documentation helps other developers understand the package
- Semantic versioning makes dependency management more reliable
